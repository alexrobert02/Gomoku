# Gomoku

## Overview
This is a client-server application built in Java for competitive Gomoku gameplay. It supports both 1v1 matches and tournaments with 8 participants. The client and server communicate over TCP, ensuring reliable real-time interactions. The backend, developed with Spring Boot, stores game history and player data in a PostgreSQL database. Multi-threading is used to handle concurrent matches efficiently.
